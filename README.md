# Crash Docs

Welcome to the Crash Docs.
In an effort to make Crash as easy and transparent as possible for users new and experienced I'm starting to pour my brain out into doc pages.

# Helping

Please open PRs, issues and anything. Even pointing out my terrible spelling is appreciated.

# Building and Debugging

1. Use vscode, you deserve it
2. Run the only available debug option
3. Open localhost:1313 with your browser
4. Marvel

# Editing

This site is written using Hugo and served with GitHub Pages.
Hugo is pretty easy, and it uses Hextra as the theme.
