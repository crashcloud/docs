Changes are how Crash captures a change during Rhinos runtime. This can be a box being transformed, a Grasshopper component being added to the canvas, or anything you need to communicate to other users of a Shared Model. These changes can even be completely independent of the Rhino Doc.

# Examples of a potential change

- Selecting an Object
- Deleting an Object
- Changing the Layer of an Object
