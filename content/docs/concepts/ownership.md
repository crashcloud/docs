There are currently two types of Ownership in Crash

### Unreleased Ownership

Before your changes are released you own them and no one else can change them.

### Temporary Ownership

If you select Geometry, you will lock it for all other users, it is "checked out" until you deselect it. This prevents two users changing the same item.
