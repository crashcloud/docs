## Crash

![Crash Model](crash-model.png)

## The Collaborators Panel

![Users Panel](users-panel.png)

The users panel shows all of the collaborators currently in the model, you will be listed at the top.

## Create a piece of Geometry

> Create a box

As soon as you finish creating the box, Crash will send this to the server, and relay it to every other user listed in the Collaborators panel. Users will see the box in the same colour next to your name. Every users colour is consistent between every collaborator.

## Troubleshooting

### Collaborators do not see my Geometry

- Are you currently in a shared model?
- Type JoinSharedModel
- If Crash tells you that you are already in a model then post an issue on discourse

### I see a red box around my geometry

The geometry cannot be sent for one or more reasons. Likely issues with the server are the reason, or the geometry is too large.

### Something else happened

This is unsual, please post a question on [discourse](https://discourse.mcneel.com/c/plug-ins/multi-user/163/)
