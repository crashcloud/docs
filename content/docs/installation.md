The simplest way to use Crash is to install the plugin and join someone elses shared model.

Crash is available for Rhino 7 on Windows, and Rhino 8 for both Windows and Mac.
To install Crash for Rhino, run the `PackageManager` command and search for Crash.
If you cannot see Crash, try updating your Rhino Version.

Crash users can join models from any Rhino Version, and do not need to be on the same version.

You may also need to check "Show Pre-release Versions"

_Note that at the time of reading, 1.4.2-beta may not be the latest version. Always use the latest version_
