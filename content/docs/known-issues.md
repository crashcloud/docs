## All Versions

- Versions of Crash and Crash.Server must match, there is no version compatibility yet
- Unsupported Elements
  - Grips
  - Groups
  - Blocks
  - Materials
  - Linestyles
    (I think you get the picture, Crash is fairly basic currently!)

## 1.4.0-wip

- Crash cannot send data items over 1mb currently
  > FIX : You can fix this by modifying config in your crash.server release/build
- Unsupported Elements
  - Layers
- Hitting undo quickly after creating an item can result in it not sending

## 1.3.0 (and previous)

Do not use old Crash Versions
