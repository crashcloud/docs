Leaving a shared model is quite simple.

Run the `LeaveSharedModel` command.

You will be asked if you want to Release your Changes before you leave.

If you do not release your changes they will not be available for other users to edit.

Crash will now attempt to join the shared model.

## Troubleshooting

### The Command does not appear

If the command does not appear, make sure you have installed the latest version of Crash correctly.

### I got message "You are not connected to a shared model"

This means you weren't able to leave a model you were not a part of anyway.
If this is unexpected because you thought you were in a model, check your connection and the server by pasting its URL into your browser.

### Something else happened

This is unsual, please post a question on [discourse](https://discourse.mcneel.com/c/plug-ins/multi-user/163/)
