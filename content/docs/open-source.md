## Crash is Open Source

Crash is completely transparent in its code and is user-driven.
The Crash tools will be open source and free forever to allow anyone to ceate their own shared servers, models and joing them with full access to the tools' source code.

## Why is Crash Open Source?

I believe to make a software truly hackable it has to be open source.
I also believe creating a closed source application designed to improve collaboration, is very mcu against the spirit of collaboration.

## License

Crash is MIT Licensed which means you can do anything with it, you can even sell it, redistribute it and edit it as you wish.

## Why this license?

I want crash to be as accessible and easy to use as possible. This license makes your life easier, which at its very nature, Crash is designed to do.
