{{< callout type="warning" >}}
The Crash plugin system is a work in progress and the API can and will change version to version. Please do not build any plugins you completely rely on.
{{< /callout >}}

Crash allows for 3rd party plugins to extend and even entirely replace the default functionality. The Crash plugin system is integrated into the yak package manager system within Rhino.
