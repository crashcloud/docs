By default all of the geometry you ceate as a collaborator is temporary and cannot be edited by other users.
By only sending temporary geometry crash does not have to block other users with your changes and does not interrupt their undo stack constantly allowing for a fluent experience.

## Release

There are two options for releasing geometry.

**`Release`**

Every temporary change you have will be sent to every other user and baked

**`ReleaseSelected`**

Every selected temporary change you have will be sent to every other user and baked

## Troubleshooting

### The Command does not appear

If the command does not appear, make sure you have installed the latest version of Crash correctly.

### Something else happened

This is unsual, please post a question on [discourse](https://discourse.mcneel.com/c/plug-ins/multi-user/163/)
