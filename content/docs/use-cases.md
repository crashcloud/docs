# Potential Use Cases

## Collaboration

Primarily Crash is designed for users to collaborate on the same model. The goal is that any Model that could be in Rhino can be in Crash worked on by as many people as needs to.

## Live Modelling

Multiple users can sit in a model together around a desk and quickly iterate on a model together, possibly with a base model or completely from scratch.

## Annotation, Markup & Reviews

Other users can log into a model and annotate, markup or leave reviews and required changes, by using text, text dots or geometry.

A plugin could be made to make this even more efficient than using text dots.

## Educational

Using the Follow Camera setting any number of students can follow a teacher as they move around a model and add elements. Students can also detatch from this and look around the model as they need, especially if they missed something earlier.

A plugin could even be made to share Command history from the teacher.

## Presentations

Using the Follow Camera setting any number of attendants can follow a presenters view as they move around a model, they can also mark parts of the model with dots and ask questions and leave comments from within the model live.

## Cloud Storage

As Crash is server based models can be opened from any machine at work or home by knowing the address and having the correct login details.
