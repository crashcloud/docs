## The Collaborators Panel

![Users Panel](images/users-panel.png)

The collaborators panel shows all of the users currently in the model, you will be listed at the top.

This panel is also interactive, and offers a few options

## Camera View

The camera view has 3 settings

### Do not show users camera

Hides that specific users camera from view

### Show users Camera

Shows that specific users camera, so you can see them moving around the model

### Follow users Camera

Choosing this option will mean your Rhino view is identical to the chosen users view. As they move, you see their movements and will see what they see. This is very useful for presentations and lecturing.

## Geometry Toggle

The checkbox next to each name will hide or show geometry users are actively working on. Sometimes this might get in the way of your editing, or be distracting.

Toggle the checkbox off, and you will not see that specific users unreleased geometry. You will still recieve it in the background of course. And if the user Releases their geometry, you will see that.

## Troubleshooting

### I cannot see the panel

Run the `ShowCrashUsers` command

### I do not see any collaborators

You are the only _active_ collaborator

### Something else happened

This is unsual, please post a question on [discourse](https://discourse.mcneel.com/c/plug-ins/multi-user/163/)
