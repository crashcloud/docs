## Crash is Open Source

Crash is completely transparent in its code and is user-driven.
Crash will be open source forever

## Crash is very Hackable

Crash is designed to be as user-customisable as possible. This extends pass settings and includes the ability to write plugins, and even offer changes to the source code.

# Why shouldn't I use Crash?

## Crash is new and untested

Bugs are to be expected and Crash might not be as stable as you need right now.
